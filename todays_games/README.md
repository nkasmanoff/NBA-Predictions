Today's Games
--------------


The goal of this repo is to now apply the model to games being played NOW. By scraping the same sources used to obtain games from older seasons, I can now do the same thing with games going on today, and created educated guesses as to who is supposed to win these games. The scraping methods will be done here, as well as an attempt to make a pipeline that immediately downloads the matchups + their respective spreads, converts to the used formats as before, then spits out a guess. 

To see a running list of odds, predictions, and result, please check the output.txt document.
