Today's Games
--------------


The goal of this repo is to now apply the model to games being played NOW. By scraping the same sources used to obtain games from older seasons, I can now do the same thing with games going on today, and created educated guesses as to who is supposed to win these games. The scraping methods will be done here, as well as an attempt to make a pipeline that immediately downloads the matchups + their respective spreads, converts to the used formats as before, then spits out a guess. 




Update
------


So while it is possible to scrape the rolling statistics of these teams and their matchups, it is not possible to acquire the spreads of these games the day of via oddshark.com. As a result, a different source for these values must be attained elsewhere, and is the current focus of my search.
