Relevant Statistics
===================


This folder shows my work and result at trying to identify the box score statistics most relevant to picking the winner of the NBA games. 

The way I did this is using the plus minus (how much a team won or lost by) as one dataset, and the other being each individual box score statistic, I calculated the correlation of each of these series in order to determine which values are the most and least correlated to a winner.
